# Rock_Paper_Scissors

This is my first attempt and javascript learning on the Odin Project by creating a rock, paper, scissors game.

1. First i created a HTML boiler plate with just a title and a seperate js file. I linked the js file in my HTML index template.

2. Next working on the js file i created a couple of parameters for the game logic round, user and computer score varibles.

3. Next i created a user input function with a varible to show a user prompt for user input.

4. Next i created a cumpter input selection using a random number varible with math floor/random parmaters sso that the cumpter choice is different for each round.

5. next i created a playround function and included the paremnters for a single round. This included the different combinations of user and computer choices. and console logged the outcome.

6. Last i created a game funtion which included a for loop for a 5 round game. This funtion also kept a record of the computer and user score of each round.

Issues

Theres was some issues i couldn't quite figure out.

1. Window prompt would not display anything on first input.
2. Also user vinput validation on window prompt. e.g user could input anything. Not figures out how you can keep user input to just Rock, Paper Scissors?

i will try and find out the solutions to these and come back and amed the code at a later date if necessary.
